# ATS_RESUME_GENERATOR-AND-KEYWORDS_EXTRACTOR

🚀 Introducing My AI-Based ATS Resume Generator! 🚀

As a student developer, I've always been passionate about building projects that have real-world utility. With job hunting becoming more competitive than ever, I wanted to create a tool that empowers job seekers to stand out—by ensuring their resumes are ATS-friendly.

💻 What is it?
My ATS Resume Generator is an AI-based web application that helps you create a professional resume tailored to specific job descriptions. It utilizes NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques to extract key skills and keywords from the job description, ensuring your resume is optimized for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

📝 Key Features:

Resume Generation: Automatically generate a well-structured, ATS-compliant resume based on your personal details and job description.

Keyword Extraction: Get a list of key job-specific skills and keywords from the job description, which you can use to tailor your resume further.

PDF Download: Download your resume in a clean and professional PDF format ready to be sent to employers.

🌟 Why is it important?
Many companies use ATS to filter resumes before a human even sees them. By optimizing your resume with the right keywords and structure, you increase your chances of being noticed by hiring managers.

🔧 Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS (for a sleek and user-friendly interface)

Backend: Python (with Flask for the server-side logic)

AI: SpaCy for keyword extraction and NLP tasks

This project was an exciting challenge, combining both front-end design and machine learning to build a truly helpful tool for anyone looking to make their resume shine in the competitive job market.

I'm thrilled with the results and hope it can help others land their dream jobs! 💼🌟
